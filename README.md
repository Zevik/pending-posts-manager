# Pending Posts Scanner

A Chrome extension that monitors Facebook group pending posts for specific keywords and saves results to Google Sheets.

## üéØ Purpose

This extension scans **pending posts** (posts waiting for admin approval) in Facebook groups, unlike the original extension that scans published posts. It's designed for group administrators and moderators who want to monitor content before it gets published.

## üöÄ Features

- **Pending Posts Monitoring**: Scans posts waiting for approval in Facebook groups
- **Keyword Detection**: Searches for specific keywords in pending post content
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Automatically saves found posts to Google Sheets
- **Google Forms Support**: Can also send data to Google Forms
- **Multi-Group Support**: Monitor multiple groups in sequence
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Set intervals between groups and rounds
- **Daily Break**: Configure break times to pause monitoring

## üìã Requirements

- **Admin/Moderator Access**: You must be an admin or moderator of the Facebook groups you want to monitor
- **Google Account**: For Google Sheets/Forms integration
- **Chrome Browser**: This is a Chrome extension

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`

- **Google Form ID**: Alternative option to send data to Google Forms

### Group Configuration
Add your groups with URLs ending in `/pending`:
- **Group Name**: Descriptive name for the group

- **Keywords**: Comma-separated list of keywords to search for

### Advanced Features
- **Daily Break**: Set times when monitoring should pause
- **Rerun Interval**: How often to restart the entire monitoring cycle

## üìù Usage

1. **Set up your groups**: Enter group URLs ending with `/pending`
2. **Configure keywords**: Add keywords separated by commas
3. **Set up Google Sheets**: Create a spreadsheet and add its URL
4. **Start monitoring**: Click the "Start" button
5. **Monitor progress**: The extension will show toast notifications as it works

## üîç URL Format

**Important**: Group URLs must end with `/pending` to access pending posts:

‚úÖ **Correct**: `https://www.facebook.com/groups/123456789/pending`
‚ùå **Wrong**: `https://www.facebook.com/groups/123456789`

## üìä Data Saved

For each matching post, the extension saves:
- **Post Date**: When the post was created
- **Keyword Found**: Which keyword matched
- **Content**: The post text content
- **URL**: Link to the post
- **Author**: Who wrote the post
- **Group Name**: Which group it's from
- **Status**: "pending" (to distinguish from published posts)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Posts Found
- Verify you're an admin/moderator of the group
- Check that the URL ends with `/pending`
- Make sure there are actually pending posts in the group

### Extension Not Working
- Check console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- Verify permissions are granted
- Make sure you're logged into Facebook

### Google Sheets Not Working
- Check your Google Sheets URL is correct
- Verify you have edit permissions to the sheet
- Ensure the Google OAuth is properly configured
